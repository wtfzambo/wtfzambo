### Ciao, I'm Zambo! 👋

I'm a cloud data engineer from Italy 🍕🇮🇹.

🎯 I have a knack for building simple and streamlined experiences, abstracting away the boring stuff so users can focus on what truly matters.\
My work is driven by my keen interest in design, strong communication skills, and a minimalist approach.

- 🛠️ My tools of the trade include: python, SQL, typescript, AWS, Docker, Pulumi, dbt, pyspark.
- 🔭 Head Chef of Data at [Vinhood](https://business.vinhood.com/), where I built the data stack from the ground up. 
- 🌱 I firmly believe in lifelong learning, constantly exploring new avenues that can make me a better professional.
- ⛵ When I'm not cooking up data, you'll find me sailing off into the sunset, embarking on new adventures whenever the opportunity arises.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Before immersing myself in the world of data, I was on the path to becoming a chef!
