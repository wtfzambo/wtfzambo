### Ciao, I'm Zambo! 👋

I'm a cloud data engineer from Italy 🍕🇮🇹.

🎯 I develop cloud-based data solutions: from data pipelines to tracking systems to dashboards, my goal is to enable businesses in making fast, data-driven decisions that they can rely upon.

🔥 I have a knack for building simple and intuitive systems, keeping the complexities behind the scenes, so users can focus on what truly matters.\
My work is driven by my keen interest in design, strong communication skills, and a minimalist approach.

- 📔 My recipe book includes: python, SQL, typescript, AWS, Docker, Pulumi, dbt, pyspark.
- 🔭 Head Chef of Data at [Vinhood](https://business.vinhood.com/), where I built the data stack from the ground up. 
- 🌱 I firmly believe in lifelong learning, constantly exploring new avenues that can make me a better professional.
- ⛵ When I'm not cooking up data, you'll find me sailing off into the sunset, embarking on new adventures whenever the opportunity arises.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Before immersing myself in the world of data, I was on the path to becoming a chef!
- 😅 I may or may not overuse food-themed metaphors.
